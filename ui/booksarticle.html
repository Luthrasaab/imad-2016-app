        <h2>Laura Bush promotes reading
        </h2>
        <p>
            In brief remarks Wednesday to the annual meeting of the Assn. of American Publishers in New York, First Lady Laura Bush called books her "greatest love affair" and warned that a "nation that does not read for itself cannot think for itself."

Bush, a former librarian whose advocacy of books and literacy have long made her popular in the publishing industry, cited such fictional characters as the Brothers Karamazov and "an intriguing man named Gatsby" and worried that many Americans had never heard of them.

"A nation that does not read for itself cannot think for itself and a nation that cannot think for itself risks losing both its identity and its freedom," said Bush, who called the passion for reading "learned behavior that should be taught at home and at schools."

    <h2>BET to produce 'The Book of Negroes' as its first scripted miniseries</h2>
    <p>
        BET, which in the last few years has moved forward with its first scripted comedies and a drama, is now moving into the miniseries arena.

The cable outlet will produce a six-part miniseries, "The Book of Negroes," a historical drama based on the prize-winning novel by Lawrence Hill. The project will star Cuba Gooding Jr., Louis Gossett Jr. and Aunjanue Ellis.
The miniseries will revolve around Aminita Diallo, an 11-year-old girl living in a West Africa village who is kidnapped and sent to South Carolina as a slave. The story chronicles her capture and enslavement and will conclude with her eventual emancipation in England.

BET executives announced the project at their upfront presentation in New York, where they also announced the renewals of comedies "The Game" and "Real Husbands of Hollywood." A pickup for the second season of drama "Being Mary Jane" had been announced previously.
